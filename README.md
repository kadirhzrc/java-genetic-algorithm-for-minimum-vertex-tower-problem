# java-genetic-algorithm-for-minimum-vertex-tower-problem
A Java program that uses genetic algorithm along with binary tournament selection with user defined input parameters for population size, number of generations and mutation rate for minimum vertex tower problem.
Minimum vertex tower problem is about including all nodes in a graph that can be reached through an edge by selected nodes with minimum possible cost.
Example graph files are given in text files with their densities as the name.

.txt format is constructed as:
1000 -> number of nodes
30000 -> number of edges
0 0,83 -> cost of each node
1 0,48
...
999 -> 1,12
0 12 -> edges from node 0
0 128
...
